This is 2D JavaScript Multiplayer game, where you can shoot and move on the map with other players.

What I use:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) for server run.
- [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/) and [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) for client side game and [Howler.js](https://howlerjs.com/) library for 3D sounds.
- [Socket.io](https://socket.io/) for the networking between server and clients.
- and also [Apache](http://www.apache.org/) server, or [Xampp](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html), for running web server.

## New Features!

The game already has working Multiplayer engine, so you can play and test the game with more players in one map.

I added some screenshots of game and server:

### Menu for selecting cube color and name

### In the game, there is safe zone, where people cannot shoot and cannot be eliminated

### Also i created server settings page for easy control with constant variables

### Why "Wisteria" ?

I just like this tree, called Wisteria and also it has very nice name. So far, it's just such a temporary name, I don't have a fancy name yet.
